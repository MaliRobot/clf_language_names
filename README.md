# clf_language_names

Small application to present data on names of languages collected from three sources: Wikipedia, Lingvoj and CLDR. This was a work on behalf Languages Foundation.

Task was to find, as many as possible, the names of other languages in every available language, with more focus on languages currently present on Wikipedia. 

This resulted in two json files, one containing Wikipedia languages and the other with non-Wikipedia languages. 

Language data is presented comparatively for each of the sources, also with ISO numbers, wiki codes and our own CLF codes.
